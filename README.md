### Team 01 - jText - Java Text Editor ###


1. Please document ALL of your code, if there is any room for interpretation, generate documentation.
	As we have multiple people working on things, this is crucial for us to move forward in development.
2. Git Workflow:
	- Clone*/Pull from Repository
	- Create Branch to work on Feature
	- Commit Feature when done
	- Pull from Repository
	- Push Branch to Repository for Merge Consideration
	- After Merged with Master, Pull Master Branch again.
	This workflow will help us keep track of changes and to ensure viability on our features.
3. If you get stuck on your feature, ask for help either in the computer lab or from another project member.

* - Applies to first time you download repository.

That's all I have for now, Thanks!
